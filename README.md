Group Lead Helper is an addon that is based off my popular Raid Lead Helper WeakAura.  This is a tool designed to be a lightweight addon that will help you with your raid leading and dungeon leading.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with other addons like MRT, DBM, BigWigs, and WeakAuras.  It is not a replacement for those addons, but a supplement to them.

## Features (Current and Planned)
### NOTE: This a pre-release and not all features are available yet.

* Comp information including break points for raids.
* Leader information and current difficulty indicator.
* Group buff availability and buff tracking.
* Group overview (with Details!) for repair, gems, enchants, and more.
* Monitoring of players that go offline.
* Monitoring of who lusted and when.
* Monitoring of who resurrected a player and when.
* Much more!

## Documentation
* Use /glh to access the addon outside the minimap icon.
* /glh help to see a list of options you can use.
* Make sure you go into the settings to customize the addon.
* To move the screen, click the lock next to the X button.  When it is green,
    you can move the screen.  Click the lock again to lock it in place.

## Miscellaneous
This is a new addon and while I have been working hard to debug it, I am sure there will be issues.
